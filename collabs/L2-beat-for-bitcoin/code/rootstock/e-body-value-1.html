      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Rootstock is a merge-mined, EVM-compatible Bitcoin sidechain. As a merge-mined network, Bitcoin miners can concurrently mine for Rootstock's consensus. As an EVM-compatible network, developers can deploy Solidity smart contracts with arbitrary logic. Rootstock has an enshrined cross-chain BTC asset called "Smart Bitcoin" (RBTC), which is pegged 1:1 to BTC and secured by a permissioned 12-seat multi-sig federation.</p>

      <h2>Risk Analysis</h2>
      	<h3>State validation</h3>
      		<h4>Sidechain nodes</h4>
          <p>Rootstock full nodes are able to verify the state of the RSK blockchain. Rootstock does not currently store any data on the Bitcoin Layer 1. Anyone can run an RSK node and validate the state of the RSK blockchain.</p>
        <h3>Data availability</h3>
        	<h4>Stored on sidechain</h4>
      		<p>The data for Rootstock' state updates is stored on Rootstock blockchain.</p>
        <h3>Upgradeablilty</h3>
      		<h4>Community-led</h4>
          <p>RSK Improvement Proposals are used to manage network upgrades. After a RSK improvement proposal is accepted by the community, RSK node operators then update their node software to accept the proposed network upgrade.</p>
        <h3>Block producer failure</h3>
        	<h5>Merge-mining</h5>
      		<p>Rootstock blocks are produced by Bitcoin miners who merge-mine the Rootstock network. There is no secondary, federated network of block producers, or centralized entity, that have higher liveness and censorship risks.</p>
        <h3>BTC Bridge</h3>
        	<h5>Custodial multi-sig</h5>
      		<p>The current Bitcoin bridge between Bitcoin and Rootstock is operated by a federated multi-sig of 12, reffered to as the Powpeg. Users' Bitcoin can be stolen if a majority of these seats collude with each other.</p>
