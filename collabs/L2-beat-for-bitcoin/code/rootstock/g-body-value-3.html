      <h2>L1 Verification</h2>
      <h3>None</h3>
      <p>Bitcoin is not used to verify the state of the Rootstock blockchain. All transactions and state updates are stored and verified on the Rootstock blockchain.</p>
    <section id="section6">
      <h2>Consensus</h2>
      <h3>Merge-mining</h3>
      <p>Rootstock is merge-mined. Currently, more than 35% of Bitcoin miners are engaged in RSK merge-mining.</p>
      <h2>Bitcoin Hashpower</h2>
      <h3>Rootstock transaction finality and block ordering is not secured by Bitcoin hashpower</h3>
      <p>RSK is a sidechain. This means that Bitcoin hashpower doesn't directly influence the transaction ordering and finality of RSK blocks. RSK has a different difficulty and hash rate than Bitcoin. While Bitcoin miners merge-mine RSK, and there are security benefits to having that architecture, miners of the RSK network are still considered "RSK miners".</p>
      <h2>Alternative Token</h2>
      <h3>None</h3>
      <p>Rootstock does not have a custom token. The native token on the Rootstock blockchain is RBTC, which is a token backed by BTC.</p>
    <section id="section7">
      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <h3>State correctness</h3>
      <p>Rootstock miners (Bitcoin miners who merge-mine the Rootstock blockchain) enforce state correctness.</p>
      <h3>All transactions are recorded on the RSK blockchain</h3>
      <p>All transactions that are executed on the RSK blockchain are recorded on the RSK ledger. All RSK nodes can view these transactions.</p>
      <h3>Data availability</h3>
      <p>Rootstock stores data on the Rootstock blockchain. Anyone running an RSK node can access and verify the state of the RSK blockchain.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="section8">
      <h2>Operator</h2>
      <h3>Open</h3>
      <p>Block production is permissionless. Anyone who is willing to merge-mine can produce blocks and earn rewards. If interested parties do not possess enough capital to compete in the Bitcoin mining market, they can join a mining pool.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="section9">
      <h2>Withdrawals</h2>
      <h3>Reliant on Rootstock signers</h3>
      <p>Withdrawals are currently permissioned by a federated group of signers. Users must trust, that when they deposit BTC into the Roostock blockchain, the signers will not collude and steal their BTC. Learn more about the Powpeg mutli-sig here.</p>
    <section id="section10">
      <h2>Source Code</h2>
      <h3>Open-source</h3>
      <p>Rootstock is open-source. The node software is also open-source, and anyone can run an RSK node.</p>
