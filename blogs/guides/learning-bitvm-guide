ICYMI, the ZeroSync team released a paper called BitVM that has some interesting properties that could potentially enable rollups on Bitcoin without a soft fork.

Bitcoin educator Bob Bodily describes BitVM as a new computing paradigm that leverages the universal gate NAND (along with other gates) within Taproot leaves with pre-signed transactions in optimistic rollup prover/verifier/challenger fashion to theoretically enable any computation on Bitcoin itself.

It’s okay if you don’t understand that immediately. We’ve built this page as a resource to help guide you through learning about BitVM.

Before working through this guide, you should have some familiarity with:

- Bitcoin Script
- Blockchain Virtual Machines (maybe including the EVM)
- NAND Gates

### 1st - Read the BitVM paper

The best place to start is at the source. Read the BitVM paper.

### 2nd - Read Bob Bodily’s explainer(s)

Bob Bodily released a breakdown on what this means, and how it could add more functionality to Bitcoin. This is a really digestible breakdown, and a great place to start.

Read his breakdown here. After that, check out his 24 and 48 hour updates on this explanation for further context.

### 3rd - Read Ichiro Kuwahara’s explainer on BitVM

Ichiro Kuwahara released a “stupidly good explainer" on BitVM via this blog post. This is a great building block to further your understanding.

Read the post here.

### 4th - Listen to Stephan Rivera’s podcast with Robin Linus and Super Testnet

Stephan Rivera hosted a discussion with Robin Linus and Super Testnet on BitVM. They break it down well here and provide a good tl;dr at the end of the episode.

### 5th - Listen to Robin Linus’ talk on BitVM

Rob Linus gave a presentation on BitVM at Bitcoin Amsterdam. This is a bit more technical than the podcast.

Watch that here.

## Pause

After digesting all of this information, you should probably have a better understanding on what the technology means for Bitcoin. We recommend that you draft notes on all of these topics to help retain some of that information.

Want to cross-reference your notes? Bitcoinrollups.io’s maintainer, Ian, drafted some notes on BitVM. You can find those here.

### 6th - Listen to Cartsen Munk’s presentation on BitVM’s potential
Carsten Munk of Cartesi Project has been one of the more active builders on BitVM. He gave a presentation on how BitVM could potentially enable a ZK Verifier in Bitcoin.

Watch here.

### 7th - Review tweets on BitVM’s potential applications
There are a few tweets on different applications and development updates on BitVM. Check those out below. Even if you’re not a dev, it might be helpful to work through.

### 8th - You’re up to speed!

That wasn’t too painful was it? After reviewing all of that information, you should have a decent understanding on BitVM. 

We recommend you join the BitVM telegram group to continue following the discussion and development around this. And, if you feel like this guide is missing anything, please add a section via our GitHub repo.
