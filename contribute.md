Thanks for checking out the contributor section for Bitcoinrollups.io!

We're building an information resource about the development of zk-rollups on Bitcoin. Everything we do is initially documented in GitHub and distributed via our website or social media accounts. This includes, but is not limited to, tweet threads for @Bitcoinrollups, The Bitcoin Rollup Newsletter, and our website.

We're excited that you're interested in contributing, and wanted to outline a few ways you can get involved :)

## Get involved

### Download a wallet for tips

Bitcoinrollups is currently managed by a volunteer, so we do not pay bounties for contributions. But, we do tip contributors a small amount for completing tasks listed in the issues section. We can send tips via lightning or shielded wBTC on Arbitrum. Please download Phoenix wallet for lightning tips, and Railway wallet for shielded wBTC tips.

### Head to the issues section

We post the items where we need contributions in the issues section of this github repo. Head there and decide which ones you'd like to take on :) You'll need a GitHub account for this.

### Comment on the task you want to complete

Comment on the task that you'd like to complete. This will notify the repo's owner that you're working on it.

You can work within GitHub or your preferred platform. For example, if you're writing a tweet thread, and you prefer to do that in Google docs, you can write the thread there and then copy and paste as a pull request in this repo to get it added to this repository.

### Create a pull request 

When you finish completing your task, create a pull request to either 1) edit the document you're looking to change or 2) add a document within a specific folder in the repo. Here's a tutorial on how to create a pull request.

### Comment your address, wait for merge and get tipped in BTC

After you create your pull request, comment your lightning or shielded wBTC, 0zk address. After we accept the pull request, and add the information to the repository, we will send you a tip. We will then add your content to the relevant medium (social media, website, etc.).

## That's it!
